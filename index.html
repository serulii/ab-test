            In this scenario, I was designing for a website (MedX) that allows
            users to schedule doctor's appointments. I wanted to see if making a
            small change to the UI of the website--primarily with spacing and
            color choices--would make it more convenient and intuitive for users
            to navigate the page and book the appointment they wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words: will changing the UI of MedX help users find and
            book an appointment faster?
          </p>

          <p>
            I used an A/B test to help answer this question. By changing the
            website slightly and tracking how quickly and easily users were able
            to navigate to the correct appointment and click the "schedule
            appointment" button on both old and new versions of the website, I
            could analyze how a small change in the UI affected the user's
            experience.

            Once I identified the key problems with the original website, I made
            a series of speed sketches culminating in a final sketch. My goal
            was to simplify the structure of the menu, so I ditched the
            slideshow on the original website and used a simple grid for the
            menu.
          </p>

          <p>
            I then created and annotated a lo-fi mockup of the revised website
            with Figma!

          <img style="width: 500px" src="img/hifi_desktop_2.png" alt="" />
          <img
            style="width: 500px; object-fit: cover"
            src="img/hifi_tablet.png"

          <p>
            In the hi-fi stage, I ended up changing a couple of things! Firstly,
            I decided that having an image as the background of the header was
            too cluttered since I wanted the focus to be on the menu items, so I
            removed it. I additionally made the reserve button more prominent.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the overall style guide, I used the logo of the restaurant as a
            reference and matched the style with modern, sleek-looking fonts and
            colors.

          <p>Nice! The website is looking much cleaner! :)</p>
          <p>
            Looking back, if I had more time, these are some things I would
            extend and improve upon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implementing sorting the menu by category! It's currently not
              interactive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding more personality to the website--while it's readable and
              easier to understand, it could use an aesthetics touch-up!
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding some of the extra features from the original website, such
              as a way of indicating if a dish is spicy and the "log in" option.
            </li>
          </ul>
