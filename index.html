          <p>
            In this scenario, I was designing for a website (MedX) that allows
            users to schedule doctor's appointments. I wanted to see if making a
            small change to the UI of the website--primarily with spacing and
            color choices--would make it more convenient and intuitive for users
            to navigate the page and book the appointment they wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words: will changing the UI of MedX help users find and
            book an appointment faster?
          </p>

          <p>
            I used an A/B test to help answer this question. By changing the
            website slightly and tracking how quickly and easily users were able
            to navigate to the correct appointment and click the "schedule
            appointment" button on both old and new versions of the website, I
            could analyze how a small change in the UI affected the user's
            experience.

      <h2>Metrics & Analysis</h2>

      <div id="about-container" style="flex-direction: column">
        <div id="about-text">
          <p>
            The metrics I chose to analyze were:
            <ol>
              <li>Misclick rate (the frequency with which users click something else on the page before finding the correct button for the task)</li>
              <li>Time on page (time spent on the webpage for each user group)</li>
              <li>Mouse move distance (the amount they moved the mouse)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            For each metric, I created the following hypotheses:
          </p>
          <p>MISCLICK RATE</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Null hypothesis: The frequency with which users click something other than the correct button is about the same between version A and version B.</li>
            <li>Alternative hypothesis: The frequency with which users click something other than the correct button is lower in version B compared to version A.</li>
            <li>Reasoning: Since version B has the "schedule appointment" buttons highlighted in green and spacing to separate different appointments, users will be less likely to misclick on parts of the page that aren't related to their goal or on the wrong appointment.</li>
            <li>Prediction: I predict that we will be able to reject the null hypothesis since version A has a design that makes it easy to misclick.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>TIME ON PAGE</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Null hypothesis: The total amount of time spent on the webpage is about the same between version A and version B.</li>
            <li>Alternative hypothesis: The total amount of time spent on the webpage is greater in version A compared to version B.</li>
            <li>Reasoning: If version B has a more intuitive design overall, then users will spend less time searching for the button they want & thus spend less time overall on the page.</li>
            <li>Prediction: I predict that we will be able to reject the null hypothesis. However, part of this may be since users experienced version A first and thus already had some experience with the interface.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>MOUSE MOVE DISTANCE</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Null hypothesis: The amount users move the mouse is about the same between version A and version B.</li>
            <li>Alternative hypothesis: The amount users move the mouse is greater in version A compared to version B.</li>
            <li>Reasoning: This makes the assumption that users who are confused or looking at more parts of the page will move the mouse more to look for the correct button. If version B has a clearer design, then users will move the mouse less.</li>
            <li>Prediction: I predict that we may fail to reject the null hypothesis because users move the mouse differently. Some users may prefer to observe a website before moving the mouse.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>TIME ON PAGE</p>
          <p>
            I chose to run a one-tailed t-test because we are trying to find if the time on the page is higher in A compared to B. I chose a significance level of 0.05.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average time users spent on version A is 29411.25ms, while the average time users spent in version B is 10479.27ms. Overall, users spent more time on version A on average.
          </p>
          <p>
            The p-value (that A>B) turned out to be 0.000566. This is lower than our significance level of 0.05, meaning that the difference between A and B with respect to the time users spent on the page is statistically significant!
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, we reject our null hypothesis. There is thus statistically significant evidence that the alternative hypothesis (users spend more time on website A compared to website B) is true.
